# Optional offline neural TTS backends:
# - Marked with python_version constraints so Python 3.13+ can still install base deps.
# - If these packages aren't installed (or the CLI isn't on PATH), the voices simply won't show in the UI.
# Note: kokoro-tts brings in kokoro-onnx as a dependency automatically
